To get a development environment, first make sure that you have the [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) installed. Then clone our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ossd-s23/YouTube-Customizer) to your local device and visit the Mozilla Firefox debugging page `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in the Firefox browser. Click the _Load Temporary Add-on..._ button and select `src/manifest.json`. Then you will be able to simulate an environment with this extension until you exit the browser.
