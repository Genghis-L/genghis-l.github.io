My name is Kehan(Genghis) Luo (骆可瀚), and I am currently a senior undergraduate at <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/">NYU Shanghai</a>, pursuing a double major in Honors Mathematics and Data Science(AI track). 
I am deeply passionate about the future of machine learning and have conducted research in areas such as diffusion models, high-dimensional sampling, and learning theory, exploring both theoretical and practical approaches. 
Additionally, I am highly interested in applying machine learning techniques to various fields including medical treatment, finance, etc.
