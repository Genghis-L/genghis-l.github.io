## Overview

In our final project, we developed an enhanced chat system, adding both a graphical user interface (GUI) and an online Tic Tac Toe game. Our goal was to improve the class project by creating a user-friendly login and signup system, incorporating password validation and error handling. The system stores user data securely in a JSON file, allowing easy future logins. During the demo, we showcased how users can chat, check the time, and even play Tic Tac Toe in real-time with another player, using a state machine to manage game states and determine winners. We also implemented features like the ability to replay the game. While we’re proud of our project’s functionality, we see potential for future improvements, such as enhancing security through encryption, stabilizing the system, and expanding the game to handle more complex scenarios beyond the basic 3x3 grid.
