## Overview

This is a self-organized overview of high-dimensional sampling methods including Exact and Weighted Sampling (Inverse,Rejection,Importance Sampling), Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Gibbs Sampling, Metropolis-Hastings, Lengevin Dynamics), and Sequential Monte Carlo methods. I used it as a talk at diffusion model group meeting at NYU Shanghai under Mathieu Laurière. See more details in in the [slides](http://genghis-l.github.io/assets/pdf/projects/High-Dimensional-Sampling-Methods/High_dimensional_Sampling.pdf).
