  Outline: >
    The aim of this graduate-level course is to describe the mathematical aspects of modeling high-dimensional data, with an emphasis on the computational and statistical quantitative questions. The course will describe in detail the following topics:

    - Gaussian Estimation
      - Gaussian PCA guarantees
      - From Gaussians to Gaussian mixtures: emergence of non-linear modeling

    - Probabilistic graphical models
      - D-separation and conditional independence
      - Gibbs models and Clifford Theorem
      - Basic hardness results
      - Exact inference

    - Inference and Statistical Physics
      - Free energies
      - Approximate-Message-Passing and Belief Propagation
      - Maximum-Entropy principle

    - Variational Inference
      - EM Algorithm
      - Convex Duality
      - Application: Variational Autoencoders

    - Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods
      - Metropolis-Hasting
      - Importance and Rejection Sampling
      - Perspective from Diffusions in continuous space-time
      - Functional Inequalities, spectral gap, high-dimensional aspects of MCMC

    - Measure Transportation in high dimensions
      - Optimal Transport and first consequences
      - Integral Probability Metrics
      - Statistical and Computational aspects of IPMs
      - Application: Generative Adversarial Networks

    - Generative Modeling using Neural Networks
      - Score-based Diffusion and Probability Flows
